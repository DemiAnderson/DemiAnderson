### Greetings.

My name is Andreev "Demi" Dmitry.
My main area of activity is Financial Management.
Currently I am studying Data Analysis in depth.
In the future I plan to delve deeper into ML engineering.

**What business problems can I solve:**

    * Increased revenue (e.g. personalized marketing via RFM / 
       optimization of advertising campaigns and retention by cohort)
    * Cost reduction (for example, optimization of the assortment matrix using ABC-XYZ analysis)
    * Increasing retention and LTV (changing the monetization model, 
       data-driven introduction of new features into the product, searching for weak points in the retention funnel)
    * Make your business transparent and controllable (automated data collection and storage, 
       ETL, check-up dashboards in Metabase / Power BI)
